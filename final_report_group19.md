### Introduction:
Our project is focuses on inflation more specifically CPI which stands for consumer price index. CPI is the change in price on a basket of goods either for one subject or type of product or many different types of products. CPI is one of the most well-known indicators of inflation and how it has changed over time. Inflation affects every aspect of our life and needs to be understood and potentially controlled and adapted to improve the economy or else it could be the downfall of a country's economy or the world's economy. These are very extreme consequences however it is important to understand the ramifications of inflation and the importance of being aware of it. By using a large dataset with a wide range of years for 46 different countries we feel this dataset gives the best representation of all different economies. Our project of exploring this large amount of data we feel makes it easier for a person with no previous knowledge of CPI to understand what it means and how it affects us. This is why our project is important because just looking at this data there is 293 430 rows and 8 columns so without wrangling and cleaning the data it is nearly impossible to just observe it on your own and process what it means. The addition of visualizations further assists in the understanding and the comparison of different factors such as subjects or countries economies.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:






### Question 1

#### What affect does a government's economic system and practices have on the nations economic stability and consistency?

Most countries have conflicting opinions of how to control the economy and by observing how different economies lead to a more efficient or stronger economy we can learn what economies are best over a long term rather than a single year.

The first graph is a violin plot which displays 3 different countries total CPI for all years. India has a more socialist economy, New Zealand is a more capitalist economy, and China is a more communist economy. These different economies all spend money on different things on focus on different ideas to help the economy grow and the inflation rate stay consistent year after year. A violin plot is similar to a box plot which it represents the variation of all total CPI values throughout the years the wider the image the more points in that section. This means the wider the violin plot the more consistent the CPI is through all the years and the skinnier it is the more spread out points are. This illustrates that all 3 countries are somewhat consistent and similar even with the different economic styles. New Zealand has extremely low and extremely high values, however there is a large amount of similar values. China and India don't have the same extreme values and China has a higher number of high values compared to India.

The second graph is a facet grid of 3 line plots hued by the 3 different subjects. CPI of food, energy, and total. There are also 2 lines one for Australia and one for United States of America. These 2 countries both have a mixed economy meaning by comparing these countries of similar economies in contrast with the last graph of different economies we can see if the trends are similar among all economies or if all of the countries are different even if they have the same economic structure. This would imply that economic structure does not play a large role in the change in CPI which in turn means the inflation for the country. The reason for choosing USA and Australia as well as their similar economies is that they are not near each other and their potential similarities can not be written off as a reliance of each others economies. The graph displays that for all 3 subjects the lines are very similar to each other even more similar than the violin plot of different economic systems. This indicates that different economic systems plays some part in CPI, however that is not the only factor at play in influencing the inflation rate. 


### QUESTION 2

### What patterns in the CPI lead to show whether Canada is weakeneing or stenghting its economy over the past 5 years?
