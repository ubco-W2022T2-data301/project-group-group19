## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset selected for our project is from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The dataset is produced for public consumption and is highly extensive and thoroughly built. The data itself shows the Inflation (CPI) for food, energy, and total. There is data from 46 different countries and six different organizations or combinations of countries. For the data the range of years differ from the different topics or countries. All data ends in 2022 however the earliest it starts for one of the four categories is 1914. The purpose of this dataset is to inform the public of what is happening all around the world in the economy. The wide range of data provided helps us see how much it differs from year to year and allows us to better understand what it all means. It also illustrates how difficult it can be to predict the economy due to the constant fluctuation of the world markets. By analyzing this dataset, we hope to better understand the world economy specifically the correlation between CPI and how the country runs their economy. This dataset was interesting due to inflation being such a major issue in the world we felt it was a smart idea to better understand how it truly works.
